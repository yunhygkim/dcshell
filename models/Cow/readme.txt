To make the Cow model in Figure 1:

	1. Press the "h" key.
		(h: show convex hull)
	2. Press the "w" key.
		(w: show wires of the model)
	3. Check the "grey (no color)" option.
	4. (IMPORTANT) Change "collapse vertex dist" to 0.
		- This is because the dimension of the model is very small.
		- This prevents close vertices being removed.
	5. Click "Use Heuristic" to create the middle figure.
	6. Click "Rebuild hulls" to reset the model.
	7. Click "Use Exact Volume" to create the rightmost figure.
